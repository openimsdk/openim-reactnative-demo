# OpenIM React Native Demo 

Welcome to the OpenIM React Native Demo! This application provides a demonstration of OpenIM integration into a React Native project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the demo app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Package manager for Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openim-reactnative-demo.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd openim-reactnative-demo

3. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn

### Running the App

With the dependencies installed, you can now run the demo app. Make sure you have an emulator or a physical device connected:
